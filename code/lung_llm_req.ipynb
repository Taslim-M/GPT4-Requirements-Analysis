        "Issue #3: Is the function \"start ventilation\" available only if the patient is connected? If no, what happens if the start ventilation is selected without having the patient connected? In other words, is the following scenario possible (we are in the standby mode): Select the \"start ventilation\". Connect the patient. The ventilation starts\n",
        "Issue #4: For FUN20 I can now see how breathingCycle start/end, and expirationPhase start/end can be defined, but in FUN 25 and 26, I can only see when the breathing cycle starts and when the expiration phase starts, but not how either of them finish. Perhaps I am not interpreting the graphs correctly. Could you tell me how the breathing cycle ends and expiration phase ends in PSV mode?\n",
        "Issue #5a: FUN.9 says \"Once the self-test has been completed successfully and configurations have been loaded properly the system shall start monitoring and reporting health parameters.\" is this supposed to indicate a mode change to 'Ventilation Mode' (as per Figure 2.1)?\n",

In other places, however, (e.g. FUN.4) there is a lot of detail contained in one requirement. I was wondering, in general, what your view of the relationship is between a requirement and its sub-requirements. For example, are they extra clauses in addition to the main requirement?

            "The description of the high-level software architecture for a mechanical lung ventilator system, as provided, contains several ambiguities that could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Here are some of the ambiguities identified:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Sensors/Actuators Representation**: The description mentions that sensors and actuators are represented by a \"dashed capsule,\" but it does not clarify what specific aspects or characteristics differentiate sensors from actuators within this representation. This could lead to confusion about how to distinguish between sensors and actuators in the diagram.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Controller Processing Logic**: While it states that the controller processes input according to the software's logic to make decisions, it does not specify what kind of logic or algorithms are used. This leaves the controller's decision-making process ambiguous.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Bidirectional Arrow between Sensors/Actuators and Controller**: The description mentions a bidirectional arrow to illustrate the interactive relationship, but it does not specify the nature of the data exchanged. For instance, it's unclear what specific data is sent from the sensors to the controller and what control signals are sent back to the actuators.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **GUI Representation and Functionality**: The GUI is described as a solid rectangle, which is the same representation used for the controller. This could lead to confusion about how to differentiate between these two components in the diagram. Additionally, the description of the GUI's functionality is vague, not specifying what kind of information is presented to the user or what inputs the user can provide.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Serial Communication**: The description mentions serial communication through an \"open circle\" but does not elaborate on the protocol or standards used for this communication. This leaves the specifics of how the controller and GUI communicate ambiguous.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **User Interaction with GUI**: While it mentions that the user interacts with the GUI, it does not specify the mechanisms of this interaction. For example, it's unclear whether the interaction is through touch, buttons, voice commands, or another method.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Overall System Operation**: The description provides an overview of the components and their interactions but lacks detail on how these interactions contribute to the overall operation of the mechanical lung ventilator. For instance, it does not explain how the user's inputs via the GUI affect the controller's decisions or how the system ensures patient safety.\n",
            "\n",
            "Addressing these ambiguities would require providing more detailed explanations or definitions for the components and their interactions, specifying the types of data exchanged, and clarifying the operational logic of the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The description of the high-level operation diagram of a mechanical lung ventilator contains several ambiguities that could lead to confusion or misinterpretation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in \"SelfTest Mode\" Outcome**: The description mentions that upon passing the \"SelfTest Mode\" (denoted by \"pass\"), the ventilator transitions to the \"StandBy Mode\". However, it does not explicitly state what happens if the \"SelfTest Mode\" fails. Does the system go into a \"fail-safe\" state, does it prompt for a retest, or does it have another procedure for handling test failures?\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Transition Conditions for \"Alarm Test Mode\"**: It is mentioned that from the \"StandBy Mode\", there is an option to enter the \"Alarm Test Mode\", which can be followed by powering off the ventilator. However, it's unclear if entering the \"Alarm Test Mode\" is a manual or automatic process, and what specific conditions or actions lead to transitioning from \"Alarm Test Mode\" back to \"StandBy Mode\" or directly to powering off.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Switching Between PCV and PSV Modes**: The description states that within the \"Ventilation Mode\" grouping, there are two modes: \"PCV\" and \"PSV\", with 2 unidirectional arrows between the 2 modes indicating that the ventilator can switch between these two modes. However, the term \"unidirectional arrows\" is ambiguous because it suggests a one-way direction, yet the context implies bidirectional switching capability between PCV and PSV modes. Clarification on how the switching occurs and under what conditions would be helpful.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **\"Fail-Safe\" State Conditions and Actions**: The description mentions a transition to the \"fail-safe\" state from the \"Ventilation Mode\" but does not specify what conditions trigger this transition. Additionally, it's unclear what actions the ventilator takes once in the \"fail-safe\" state, how it affects the patient, and how the system recovers from this state.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Power Off Transitions**: While it's stated that the system can transition to the final state upon \"power off\" from several modes, it's not clear if the \"power off\" action is manual or automatic in each case. Furthermore, the description does not specify if there are any conditions or procedures that must be met before powering off from these states, especially from critical modes like \"Ventilation Mode\".\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **General Flow and Decision Points**: The description provides a structured flow but lacks detail on how decisions are made (e.g., criteria for determining a \"new patient\"), how errors are handled throughout the system, and whether there are any safety checks or confirmations required before transitioning between certain modes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Addressing these ambiguities would require additional information or clarification to ensure the operational flowchart is accurately understood and implemented, especially in critical medical devices like ventilators.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The description of the GUI state machine in the provided text, which outlines the layout and functionality of a mechanical lung ventilator system, does contain some ambiguities and areas that could benefit from clarification:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **GUI Interaction with Sensors**: The description mentions a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that \"presumably\" displays readings from various sensors and controls the ventilator. The use of \"presumably\" introduces ambiguity regarding the exact functions and capabilities of the GUI. It's unclear whether the GUI can control all aspects of the ventilator system, such as adjusting the gas blend or the PEEP valve settings, or if it's limited to displaying sensor readings.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Sensor Data Flow to GUI**: There is no explicit mention of how the data from the sensors (e.g., PS, OS, PS ins, PS exp) is transmitted to the GUI. Are the connections wired, wireless, or is there a central processing unit that collects and forwards the data? The mechanism of data collection and transmission to the GUI is not described, which could be crucial for understanding the system's operation and reliability.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **GUI Controls and Feedback Mechanism**: While the GUI is associated with an LED indicator and a switch connected to power supply options, the description does not detail how the user interacts with the GUI to control the ventilator or how the GUI provides feedback to the user. For instance, it's unclear if the LED indicator signals specific states of the ventilator, errors, or power status, and how the switch influences the operation of the GUI or the ventilator system.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Power Supply to Sensors and Valves**: The description briefly mentions an AC power source and a battery for the GUI, but it does not specify how the sensors, valves (IN valve, OUT valve, PEEP valve), and the gas blender are powered. Are they also powered by the same AC source and battery, or do they have separate power requirements? This is important for understanding the system's resilience and operation during power outages.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Bidirectional Flow Sensor (FI2) Specificity**: The text mentions a bidirectional flow sensor (FI2) but does not specify how it distinguishes between inhalation and exhalation flows or how this data is utilized within the system. This could be crucial for understanding how the ventilator adjusts to the patient's breathing efforts and maintains the desired ventilation parameters.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **PEEP Valve Operation**: The description mentions the PEEP valve's purpose but does not explain how its operation is controlled or monitored. Is the PEEP valve setting adjusted manually, through the GUI, or is it automatically controlled based on sensor readings? The mechanism of action and control for the PEEP valve remains ambiguous.\n",
            "\n",
            "Addressing these ambiguities would provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the ventilator system's operation, particularly how the GUI interacts with and controls the various components of the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The description of the GUI state machine for a mechanical lung ventilator contains several ambiguities that could lead to confusion or misinterpretation during implementation or analysis. Here are the identified ambiguities:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguous Transition Conditions**: The description of the transition from the \"Ventilating\" conditional state is ambiguous. It mentions if \"No / start-up ended\", the system transitions to the \"Start\" state, and if \"Yes\", it transitions to the \"Ventilation\" state. However, the conditions \"No\" and \"Yes\" are not clearly defined in terms of what they are responding to. This could lead to confusion about what exactly triggers these transitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Inconsistent Naming**: The text refers to both \"Ventilation\" and \"Ventilating\" states, which could imply two different states or be a typo. This inconsistency could lead to confusion about whether these are intended to be the same state or two distinct states within the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Missing \"powerOff\" Event for Some States**: The description notes that each state has an exit transition leading to a final state upon \"powerOff\", except for \"SelfTest\", \"Settings\", and \"Ventilating\" conditional state. However, it later specifies that \"Settings\" and \"Ventilating\" conditional state do not have a \"powerOff\" event, without mentioning the \"SelfTest\" state in this exception. This inconsistency raises questions about whether the \"SelfTest\" state can transition to the final state upon \"powerOff\" or not.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Unclear Final State Representation**: The description mentions a final state denoted by a circle with a border but does not explicitly define or label this final state. Without a clear definition or label, it's ambiguous what this final state represents (e.g., system shutdown, error state).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Ambiguous \"SelfTest\" State Transition**: It's mentioned that the \"SelfTest\" state can lead to the final state upon a test failure, denoted by \"powerOff/Test fail\". However, it's unclear whether \"powerOff\" and \"Test fail\" are two separate events that can trigger this transition or if this transition requires a combination of both events occurring simultaneously.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Lack of Clarity on Conditional Transitions**: The description uses the term \"conditional state\" for \"Ventilating\" but does not clearly define what makes a state conditional or how conditional states differ from other states in terms of behavior or representation in the UML diagram.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Ambiguity in \"Settings\" State Transition**: The description mentions that the \"Settings\" state leads back to the \"Menu\" state after saving settings or returning to the previous menu, denoted by \"Save/Go back\". It's ambiguous whether both actions (\"Save\" and \"Go back\") lead to the same outcome or if there are conditions or consequences that differentiate these transitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Addressing these ambiguities would require clarifying the conditions and events that trigger state transitions, consistently naming states, and providing a more detailed explanation of the system's behavior, especially regarding how it handles power-off events and the characteristics of conditional states.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The provided text describes a draft of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a mechanical lung ventilator, including a UML diagram description. While the description is detailed, there are several ambiguities and areas that could benefit from clarification:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Button Functions and State Changes**:\n",
            "   - The description mentions five action buttons (\"Back,\" \"Settings,\" \"Special Actions,\" \"Start PSV,\" and \"Stop PCV\") but does not specify the functions of these buttons beyond their labels. For instance, it's unclear what actions \"Special Actions\" triggers or how \"Start PSV\" and \"Stop PCV\" affect the ventilator's operation. The ambiguity here could lead to confusion about how the GUI controls the ventilator.\n",
            "   - There is no information on whether these buttons lead to new screens, pop-up dialogs, or immediate actions within the current GUI layout.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Graphical Display Area**:\n",
            "   - The description of the graphical display area is clear in terms of layout and labeling but lacks detail on how these graphs update or interact with user inputs. For example, it's not specified if the user can interact with the graphs (zoom, scroll, select specific data points) or how real-time the data display is.\n",
            "   - The significance of the square wave pattern in the \"PAW (cmH2O)\" graph or the specific waveform pattern in the \"Vtidal (ml)\" graph is not explained. Without context, the importance of these patterns to the user or how they should be interpreted is ambiguous.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Monitoring Information**:\n",
            "   - The text lists the types of monitoring information displayed but does not describe how this information is presented (numerical values, trends over time, color-coded status, etc.) or how often it is updated.\n",
            "   - It's unclear if any of these monitoring parameters are interactive or if they trigger alarms under certain conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Alarm Interface**:\n",
            "   - The function of the \"Silence alarm\" button is presumably to mute current alarms, but it's ambiguous whether this action temporarily silences alarms or acknowledges and clears them from the system.\n",
            "   - The description of the \"Alarm messages\" banner does not specify how messages are displayed (scrolling text, list of messages, severity indication) or how the user interacts with them (acknowledge, clear, view details).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Overall GUI Interaction**:\n",
            "   - The description lacks information on the overall user interaction model of the GUI. For example, how does the user navigate between different functionalities, and how are changes (settings adjustments, start/stop ventilation) confirmed or canceled?\n",
            "   - There is no mention of any feedback mechanisms (visual, auditory) to confirm user actions or indicate system status changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, while the description provides a good overview of the GUI layout and components, it leaves several ambiguities regarding the functionality, user interaction, and feedback mechanisms that are critical for understanding how the GUI operates and supports the user in controlling the mechanical lung ventilator.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The description of the high-level operation diagram for a controller state machine in a mechanical lung ventilator, as provided, is relatively clear but does contain a few ambiguities and areas that could benefit from further clarification:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ambiguity in \"Ventilationoff\" State Naming**: The state is referred to as \"Ventilationoff\" in point 4 but is mentioned as \"VentilationOff\" (with a capital 'O') in subsequent points. This inconsistency in naming could lead to confusion about whether these refer to the same state or different states.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Unclear Transition Conditions for \"SelfTest\" State**: In point 4, the transition from the \"SelfTest\" state to the \"Ventilationoff\" state is triggered by \"SelftestPassed/Resuming Ventilation\". This phrasing could be interpreted as two separate events or a single event with a dual condition. Clarification on whether passing the self-test and resuming ventilation are two distinct events or part of the same condition would be helpful.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Ambiguity in \"Fail safe\" State Naming and Transition**: The term \"Fail safe\" is introduced in point 8 without prior mention or explanation. It's unclear whether \"Fail safe\" is a specific state that the system can enter from any other state upon an error, or if it's a general concept applied to multiple states. Additionally, the term \"Fail safe\" is typically written as \"Fail-safe\" or \"Failsafe\", so the naming convention could benefit from standardization.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Lack of Detail on Final State After Power Off**: Point 9 mentions a transition to the final state upon the \"powerOff\" event but does not describe or name this final state. It's unclear whether this final state is represented in the diagram (e.g., by a specific symbol like the initial state) or if it's simply the cessation of the system's operation.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **General Lack of Detail on Event Conditions and Actions**: While the description outlines the states and transitions, it does not provide detail on the conditions under which events are triggered or the actions taken by the system when transitioning between states. For example, what constitutes an \"error\" that triggers a transition to the \"Fail safe\" state? What specific actions or checks are performed during the \"SelfTest\" state?\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Inconsistency in Event Naming Convention**: The document uses different naming conventions for events (e.g., \"powerOn\" vs. \"start-up ended\" vs. \"SelftestPassed/Resuming Ventilation\"). Standardizing the naming convention for events could improve clarity and consistency throughout the document.\n",
            "\n",
            "Addressing these ambiguities would enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the high-level operation diagram description, making it easier for readers to understand the system's behavior and design.\n",
