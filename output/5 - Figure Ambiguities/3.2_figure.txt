The description of the draft GUI for a mechanical lung ventilator contains several ambiguities that could lead to confusion or misinterpretation during the development or use of the interface. Here are some identified ambiguities:

1. **Action Buttons in the Navigation Bar:**
   - The specific functions of the buttons "Back," "Settings," "Special Actions," "Start PSV," and "Stop PCV" are not described. It's unclear what actions these buttons perform, especially "Special Actions," which is very vague.
   - It's ambiguous whether "Start PSV" and "Stop PCV" are mutually exclusive or can be activated simultaneously, which could have significant implications for the ventilator's operation.

2. **Graphical Display Area:**
   - The description does not specify the time range or scale for the graphs, which is crucial for accurately interpreting the displayed data.
   - It's unclear how the user interacts with the graphs. Can they zoom in/out, scroll through historical data, or set alarms based on thresholds?

3. **Monitoring Information:**
   - The term "real-time" is used, but there's no mention of the update frequency for the monitoring data. In a clinical setting, the timeliness of data can be critical.
   - The description lists various monitoring parameters but does not specify the layout within the box or how these parameters are visually differentiated, which could affect readability.

4. **Alarm Interface:**
   - The functionality of the "Silence alarm" button is ambiguous. Does it temporarily mute alarms, dismiss them, or require acknowledgment before silencing?
   - The description of the "Alarm messages" banner is vague. It's unclear how messages are displayed, prioritized, or cleared, and whether there is a limit to the number of messages displayed at once.

5. **General GUI Description:**
   - The description lacks information on the overall size and resolution of the GUI, which could impact the design and usability of the interface.
   - There's no mention of color schemes or contrast, which are important for visibility and distinguishing between different elements, especially in varying lighting conditions.
   - The description does not specify how the GUI adapts to different user inputs or conditions, such as responding to critical alarms or adjusting settings.

Addressing these ambiguities is crucial for the development of a clear, functional, and user-friendly GUI for a mechanical lung ventilator, especially in a high-stakes environment like healthcare.
