After reviewing the provided excerpt from the software requirements specification of a Mechanical Lung Ventilator, here are the evaluations based on the questions asked:

1. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions in the System Requirements section as a whole:**
   - There are no glaring inconsistencies or contradictions across the different subsections of the System Requirements. The requirements are well-structured and seem to cover a comprehensive range of functionalities and safety measures necessary for the operation of a mechanical lung ventilator.

2. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions within the Functional Requirements table:**
   - There is a potential inconsistency in FUN.10 and FUN.10.3 regarding the self-test procedure. FUN.10 suggests that upon successful completion of the self-test, the user must select “New Patient” or “Resume Ventilation” before the system transitions to self-test mode, which implies the self-test occurs after this selection. However, FUN.10.3 allows for skipping or optionally rerunning individual self-test steps if “Resume Ventilation” is selected, which could imply that the self-test has already occurred. This could be confusing and may need clarification on the sequence of operations.

3. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions within the Measured and Displayed Parameters table:**
   - No inconsistencies or contradictions are evident within the Measured and Displayed Parameters table. The parameters listed are standard for ventilator operation and monitoring, and the requirements seem consistent with regulatory and operational needs.

4. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions within the Values and Ranges sub-section:**
   - There is a contradiction in PER.14 regarding the default value of Target inspiratory pressure (P_insp AP) for apnea backup settings. It states a default of 0 cm H2O, which is outside the specified range of 2-50 cm H2O. This could be a typographical error or oversight, as a default value of 0 cm H2O would not be clinically useful or safe.

5. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions within the Sensors and Interfaces sub-section:**
   - The Sensors and Interfaces sub-section appears consistent and well-detailed, providing a clear overview of how the system's sensors and interfaces operate and interact. No inconsistencies or contradictions are identified.

6. **Inconsistencies and/or contradictions within the Alarm Requirements:**
   - There is a potential inconsistency in the alarm requirements related to the Min PEEP and Max PEEP alarms (SAV.5 and SAV.24). While both are necessary, the specification does not clearly state how the system distinguishes between these two alarm conditions, especially since they both relate to the expiratory airway pressure but in opposite conditions (below or above the user-set limits). This might not be a direct contradiction but could benefit from additional clarification to avoid confusion in implementation.

Overall, the specification is detailed and covers a wide range of requirements necessary for the safe and effective operation of a mechanical lung ventilator. The identified issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with clarifications or minor adjustments to the document.
