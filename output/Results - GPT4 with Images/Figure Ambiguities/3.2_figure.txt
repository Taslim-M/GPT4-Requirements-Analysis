The description of the draft GUI for a mechanical lung ventilator contains several ambiguities that could lead to confusion or misinterpretation during the development or use of the interface. Here are some identified ambiguities:

1. **Action Buttons in the Navigation Bar:**
   - The function of the "Back" button is not clearly defined. It's ambiguous where the "Back" button would navigate to. Is it intended to return to a previous screen, a home screen, or perform another action?
   - The distinction between "Start PSV" and "Stop PCV" buttons is unclear without context. What do PSV and PCV stand for, and why is there a start button for one mode and a stop button for another? This could confuse users about how to start or stop different ventilation modes.

2. **Graphical Display Area:**
   - The description does not specify the time range or scale for the graphs, which is crucial for interpreting the displayed data accurately.
   - It's ambiguous whether the graphs are interactive. Can the user interact with these graphs for more detailed information or to adjust settings?

3. **Monitoring Information:**
   - The term "Power Source" is mentioned without specifying what information is displayed regarding it. Is it indicating whether the device is plugged into an AC source, using battery power, or something else?
   - The description lists various monitoring parameters but does not clarify if these are all displayed simultaneously or if the user needs to select specific data to view. Also, the format of the displayed data (numerical values, trends over time, etc.) is not described.

4. **Alarm Interface:**
   - The functionality of the "Silence alarm" button could be ambiguous. Does it silence all current alarms, does it silence a specific type of alarm, or does it temporarily disable future alarms?
   - The description of the "Alarm messages" banner is vague. It's unclear how messages are displayed (scrolling text, list of messages, etc.), how many messages can be displayed at once, or how the user interacts with or acknowledges these messages.

5. **General GUI Layout and Interaction:**
   - The description lacks details on the overall user interaction model of the GUI. For example, how does a user navigate between different sections or functionalities? Are there any touch gestures, keyboard shortcuts, or other interaction methods supported?
   - The visual distinction of interactive elements (buttons, graphs, etc.) is mentioned, but the specific styles used to indicate interactivity (color, shape, animation, etc.) are not described, which could lead to inconsistencies in design or user confusion.

Addressing these ambiguities is crucial for ensuring the GUI is user-friendly, intuitive, and meets the needs of its clinical users effectively.
