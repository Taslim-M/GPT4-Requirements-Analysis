Yes, FUN.9 does indicate a mode change to 'Ventilation Mode' as per Figure 2.1 in the high-level operation diagram. After the self-test and configuration loading processes are successfully completed, the system's transition into monitoring and reporting health parameters aligns with the operational flow into 'Ventilation Mode', where the system actively supports the patient's breathing through either PCV or PSV modes. This transition is a critical step in preparing the ventilator to provide the necessary respiratory support, marking the shift from preparatory stages (Start-up, SelfTest, and StandBy) to active ventilation support.
