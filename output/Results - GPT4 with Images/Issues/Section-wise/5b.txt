The repetition of the transition to Standby Mode in both FUN.9 and FUN.10.4 is intentional and serves distinct purposes within the operation of the mechanical lung ventilator. 

FUN.9 specifies that once the self-test has been completed successfully and configurations have been loaded properly, the system shall start monitoring and reporting health parameters. This requirement is focused on the transition to operational readiness after the self-test and configuration loading processes are complete. It ensures that the system is ready to monitor and report health parameters, which is a critical step before entering Standby Mode where the ventilator is ready but not actively ventilating a patient.

On the other hand, FUN.10.4 is part of a broader set of requirements under FUN.10, which deals with the actions taken after the start-up has been completed successfully. Specifically, FUN.10.4 addresses the scenario where all self-test steps have been completed successfully, allowing the transition to Standby Mode. This is part of the decision-making process where the user must select “New Patient” or “Resume Ventilation” before the system transitions to self-test mode, and eventually to Standby Mode.

The reason for this apparent repetition is that FUN.9 and FUN.10.4 cater to different stages in the ventilator's start-up sequence and user interaction process. FUN.9 is about the system's internal readiness to monitor health parameters post-self-test, while FUN.10.4 is about user decisions post-start-up affecting the transition to Standby Mode. Both are necessary to ensure a comprehensive and safe operational protocol for the ventilator, accommodating both system readiness and user input before entering a state where the ventilator is ready to ventilate a patient.
