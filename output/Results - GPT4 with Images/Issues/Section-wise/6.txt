The relationship between a main requirement and its sub-requirements in this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a Mechanical Lung Ventilator can be understood as a hierarchical structure where the main requirement outlines a broad functionality or feature of the system, and the sub-requirements provide detailed specifications, conditions, or additional functionalities that support, clarify, or implement the main requirement. 

In this context, sub-requirements are not merely extra clauses added to the main requirement; rather, they are integral components that detail how the main requirement is to be achieved or specified conditions under which the main requirement operates. This hierarchical structure allows for a clear and organized presentation of the system's requirements, ensuring that each aspect of a main requirement is thoroughly defined and that the system's functionality is comprehensively described.

For example, the main requirement FUN.5 outlines the initiation of the Start-up Mode, while its sub-requirements (FUN.5.1, FUN.5.2, FUN.5.3) specify the processes involved in the initialization, the feedback to the user upon completion or failure, and a safety condition regarding patient connection during start-up, respectively. Together, these sub-requirements combine to fully implement what the main requirement states by detailing the necessary steps and conditions for the Start-up Mode to be correctly initiated and completed.

This approach ensures that the SRS is both detailed and modular, allowing developers and stakeholders to understand not only the high-level functionalities required of the system but also the specific conditions, processes, and considerations that underpin these functionalities.
