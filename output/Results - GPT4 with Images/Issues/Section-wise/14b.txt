Yes, for parameters like PEEP and FiO2 that do not have default values specified in the StartUp mode, it implies that any value within the specified range can be chosen. The absence of a default value for these parameters suggests that the appropriate value should be determined based on the specific needs of the patient at the time of ventilation initiation. This approach allows for flexibility in setting parameters to best suit the patient's current condition, rather than adhering to a potentially unsuitable preset value.
