Based on the detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Mechanical Lung Ventilator, it's clear that the system incorporates various sensors to monitor and control the ventilation process effectively. These include flow sensors (FI1 for unidirectional flow to the patient and FI2 for bidirectional flow between the ventilator and the patient), an oxygen concentration sensor (OS), and pressure sensors (PS ins for inspiratory pressure and PS exp for expiratory pressure), among others. These sensors play critical roles in ensuring the ventilator operates within safe and effective parameters, providing essential data to the controller for real-time adjustments and monitoring.

Regarding the safety of these sensors, the SRS outlines a comprehensive self-test mode (FUN.6 and its sub-requirements) designed to verify the functionality and calibration of the system's components, including the sensors, before the ventilator is used on a patient. This self-test mode is a critical step in ensuring that the sensors and the system as a whole are functioning correctly and safely.

However, the SRS does not explicitly mention sensors for directly monitoring the state of each valve (in valve and out valve). While the functionality and safety of the valves are likely inferred through the system's ability to maintain target pressures and flows (which would be impossible with a malfunctioning valve), the absence of direct monitoring could be seen as a potential gap in the system's safety architecture.

In the context of safety-critical systems like ventilators, redundancy and direct monitoring are key principles. Directly monitoring the state of each valve with dedicated sensors could provide an additional layer of safety by ensuring that any failure or deviation from expected behavior is detected immediately, allowing the system to enter a fail-safe mode or alert the user to the issue.

Therefore, while the existing sensors and self-test procedures provide a strong foundation for safety, considering the addition of direct valve state sensors could enhance the system's robustness and reliability. This would align with the overarching safety requirements (e.g., FUN.31 - FUN.34) that prioritize patient safety above all. Adding such sensors would ensure that every critical component's status is directly monitored, further minimizing the risk of undetected failures that could compromise patient care.
