You are correct; the document does not specify default or range values for `max_exp_pause` and `max_ins_pause`. These parameters are mentioned in the "Definitions" section as "The maximum time duration of an Expiratory Pause" and "The maximum time duration of an Inspiratory Pause," respectively. However, in the sections detailing values and ranges for various parameters (sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2, and 2.3.3), no default values or ranges are provided for these two parameters. This omission means that, as it stands, the specification lacks complete information regarding the acceptable or intended limits for the duration of expiratory and inspiratory pauses, which are critical for ensuring patient safety and the effective operation of the ventilator.
