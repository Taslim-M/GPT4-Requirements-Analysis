Yes, the measured values of parameters like FiO2 (Fraction of inspired Oxygen) and PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) can be different from the values set by the user. This is because the system allows the user to set desired values for these parameters (as indicated in the requirements FUN.48.1 for FiO2 and PER.1 for PEEP), but it also continuously measures and displays the actual values of these parameters during operation (as indicated in FUN.45 for PEEP and FUN.48 for FiO2). 

The system is designed to alert the user if the measured values deviate significantly from the set values, indicating a potential issue that may need to be addressed. For example, SAV.1 specifies that the system shall raise an alarm if the delivered oxygen concentration changes by more than 3% volume of a user-controlled target FiO2 value, and SAV.5 specifies that the system shall raise a PEEP alarm if the expiratory airway pressure falls below the user-set low pressure alarm limit (Min PEEP). 

These mechanisms ensure that while the user sets desired values for optimal patient care, the system provides real-time feedback on actual conditions, allowing for adjustments and interventions as necessary to maintain patient safety and effective ventilation support.
