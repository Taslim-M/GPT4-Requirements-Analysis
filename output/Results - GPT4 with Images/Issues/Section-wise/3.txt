Based on the provided Software Requirements Specification for the Mechanical Lung Ventilator, the function "start ventilation" does not explicitly require the patient to be connected for it to be available or selected. The specifications detail the process from start-up to ventilation, including transitions between modes (PCV and PSV), but do not explicitly state that the patient must be connected before the "start ventilation" option can be selected.

However, it is important to note that FUN.5.3 explicitly states, "The patient shall not be connected to the breathing circuit when the system is powered on and through start-up and self-test." This implies that the initial system start-up and self-test procedures are designed to be conducted without the patient being connected. Following these procedures, the system transitions to Standby Mode, where ventilation parameters can be set (FUN.10.5), but it does not explicitly state that starting ventilation without a patient connected is prevented or what specific behavior the system would exhibit in such a scenario.

Therefore, based on the provided specifications, while it is not explicitly stated that the "start ventilation" function is available only if the patient is connected, the intended use and safety protocols outlined (such as the self-test and initialization processes) suggest that the system is designed to ensure readiness and safety before patient connection. The scenario of selecting "start ventilation" without having the patient connected is not directly addressed, indicating a potential area for clarification or addition in the requirements to explicitly cover this use case and ensure patient safety.
