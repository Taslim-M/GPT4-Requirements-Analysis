Based on the provided Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Mechanical Lung Ventilator, there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the ability to set ventilation parameters while having the patient connected, as mentioned in FUN10.5 and Figure 2.

FUN10.5 states, "In Standby Mode ventilation shall be off and it shall be possible to adjust all user-controlled parameters for ventilation and alarms before connecting to the patient and starting patient ventilation." This requirement suggests that all adjustments to ventilation and alarm parameters should be made before the patient is connected to the ventilator and before starting the ventilation process.

However, the confusion arises from the interpretation of Figure 2.1 and the overall operation of the ventilator as described in the SRS. Figure 2.1, as a high-level operation diagram, does not explicitly detail the process of adjusting ventilation parameters while the patient is connected. Instead, it outlines the general flow from start-up, through self-test, to standby, and then to ventilation modes (PCV or PSV), without specifying when parameter adjustments are allowed.

The key to resolving this confusion lies in understanding the operational context and safety considerations. Adjusting ventilation parameters while a patient is connected and actively being ventilated could pose risks, hence the requirement in FUN10.5 to make such adjustments in Standby Mode before patient connection. This is a common safety practice in medical device operation to ensure that any changes made to the device's settings do not inadvertently harm the patient.

Therefore, while Figure 2.1 allows for transitions between different modes of operation and indicates a general framework for ventilator use, it does not contradict FUN10.5. The requirement in FUN10.5 specifically addresses the safety protocol of adjusting parameters before patient connection and ventilation start, which is a detail beyond the scope of the high-level process flow shown in Figure 2.1.

In summary, according to the detailed SRS, it is not possible to adjust ventilation parameters while the patient is connected, as per the safety requirement outlined in FUN10.5. Adjustments must be made in Standby Mode before connecting the patient and starting ventilation, ensuring patient safety and adherence to medical device operation protocols.
