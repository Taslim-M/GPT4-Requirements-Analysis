Based on the provided Software Requirements Specification for the Mechanical Lung Ventilator, updating the parameters during ventilation (inspiration or expiration) does not explicitly imply that the inspiration/expiration duration is updated too. The specification details various parameters that can be set or adjusted, such as inspiratory pressure, respiratory rate, I:E ratio, etc., but it does not directly state that updating these parameters will automatically adjust the duration of inspiration or expiration.

However, it's important to note that certain parameters inherently influence the timing of the breathing cycle. For example, the respiratory rate (RR) and the I:E ratio directly determine the cycle's duration and the distribution of time between inspiration and expiration. Specifically, the requirement FUN.20 for PCV mode explains how the time for one breathing cycle is equal to 1/RR_PCV, and the expiratory time is calculated based on the I:E ratio. Therefore, if the user updates the RR_PCV or the I:E ratio, this will inherently change the duration of the inspiration and/or expiration phases.

In summary, while the specification does not explicitly state that updating parameters during ventilation changes the inspiration/expiration duration, changes to specific parameters like the respiratory rate and I:E ratio inherently affect these durations.
