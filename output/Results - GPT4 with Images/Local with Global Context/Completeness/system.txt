1. **Incomplete and/or Missing Details in the System Requirements Section:**
   - The System Requirements section provides a comprehensive overview of the functional requirements, safety-related functional requirements, measured and displayed parameters, values and ranges, sensors and interfaces, and alarm requirements. However, there are areas where additional details could enhance clarity and completeness:
     - **Safety and Regulatory Compliance:** While references to ISO standards are made, explicit mention of compliance with other relevant standards (e.g., IEC 60601 series for medical electrical equipment safety) and regulatory requirements for different regions (e.g., FDA in the USA, CE marking in Europe) could be missing.
     - **Environmental Conditions:** There is no mention of the operating and storage environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, altitude) the ventilator is designed to withstand.
     - **Maintenance and Serviceability Requirements:** Details on preventive maintenance, calibration, and serviceability by the end-user or technical personnel are not provided.
     - **Interoperability:** There is no mention of interoperability with other medical devices or health information systems, which is crucial for patient data management and integration into healthcare settings.
     - **User Interface Requirements:** While there is mention of a GUI, detailed requirements regarding user interface design, accessibility, and usability testing outcomes are not provided.

2. **Functional Requirements Table:**
   - The Functional Requirements table appears to be complete with ID, Requirement/Rationale, and Input Reference fields adequately filled out. Each requirement is clearly stated with a rationale, and where applicable, references to ISO standards are provided.

3. **Measured and Displayed Parameters Table:**
   - This table is also complete, with clear identification of parameters to be measured and displayed, along with the rationale. However, specific accuracy, resolution, and update frequency for each parameter could further enhance this section.

4. **Common Values and Ranges Table:**
   - The table includes ID, Requirement/Rationale, and Input Reference fields. It lists default values, ranges, and step sizes for various parameters. However, the default values for some parameters (e.g., PER.17 - Max PEEP, PER.18 - Min PEEP) are marked as "-", indicating a potential oversight or the need for clarification.

5. **Default Values and Ranges for PCV Parameters Table:**
   - This table is complete, providing clear default values, ranges, and step sizes for PCV mode parameters.

6. **Default Values and Ranges for PSV Parameters Table:**
   - Similar to the PCV parameters table, this table is complete, detailing the PSV mode parameters with default values, ranges, and step sizes.

7. **Default Alarm Thresholds Values and Ranges Table:**
   - The table is complete, listing alarm thresholds with default values, ranges, and step sizes. It also includes references to ISO standards, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

8. **Interface between GUI and Controller Table:**
   - This table is complete, detailing the parameters communicated between the GUI and the controller, including both directions of communication.

9. **Interface between Hardware and Controller Table:**
   - The table is complete, specifying the parameters set in the hardware by the controller and the values the controller gets from various sensors. It provides a clear overview of the hardware-controller interface.

10. **Alarm Requirements Table:**
    - The table is complete, listing various alarm conditions with their priority levels and rationales. References to ISO standards are included, ensuring that the alarm system meets regulatory requirements.

Overall, while the provided tables and descriptions are comprehensive, adding details on environmental conditions, maintenance, interoperability, and user interface requirements could further enhance the completeness of the System Requirements section.
