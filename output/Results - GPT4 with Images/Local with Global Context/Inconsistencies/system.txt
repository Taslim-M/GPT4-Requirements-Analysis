1. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions in the System Requirements Section as a Whole:**
   - There are no apparent inconsistencies or contradictions when considering the document as a whole. Each subsection appears to logically follow from the previous, with a clear delineation between functional requirements, measured and displayed parameters, values and ranges, sensors and interfaces, and alarm requirements.

2. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions within the Functional Requirements Table:**
   - FUN.10 and FUN.10.4 seem to contradict the high-level operation diagram described in Figure 2.1. According to FUN.10, the user must select “New Patient” or “Resume Ventilation” before the system transitions to self-test mode, but the diagram suggests that the self-test mode occurs before this decision point.
   - FUN.18 mentions that the leak compensation feature shall be disabled by default, but FUN.18.2 suggests that it is activated by the Min PEEP alarm (SAV.15), which could imply that it has a condition under which it can be automatically enabled, contradicting the "disabled by default" statement unless manual intervention is always required first.

3. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions within the Measured and Displayed Parameters Table:**
   - There are no clear inconsistencies or contradictions within the measured and displayed parameters table. The requirements seem to align well with the system's intended functions and regulatory requirements.

4. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions within the Values and Ranges Sub-section:**
   - PER.14 has a default value of 0 cm H2O for Target inspiratory pressure (P_insp_AP) in apnea backup settings, which seems inconsistent with the rationale that it should be set by the user in PSV mode in case of apnea lag. Having a default value of 0 could be unsafe or impractical without further clarification on how and when the user sets this value.

5. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions within the Sensors and Interfaces Sub-section:**
   - There are no apparent inconsistencies or contradictions within the sensors and interfaces subsection. The detailed descriptions of sensor placements and interfaces between the GUI, controller, and hardware components seem comprehensive and logically structured.

6. **Inconsistencies and/or Contradictions within the Alarm Requirements:**
   - SAV.24 and SAV.25 might present a potential contradiction or redundancy. SAV.24 discusses raising a PEEP alarm if the expiratory airway pressure exceeds the user-set desired pressure PEEP alarm limit (Max PEEP), while SAV.25 talks about an alarm for conditions reaching the alarm limit (Min PEEP) for disconnection. The distinction between these alarms, particularly in terms of "exceeding" vs. "reaching" alarm limits for PEEP, could be clearer to avoid confusion.
   - SAV.15 and FUN.18.2 could potentially contradict each other if the leak compensation feature is indeed activated by the Min PEEP alarm (SAV.15), as FUN.18 states it should be disabled by default. This could imply an automatic enabling of a feature that should be manually controlled, depending on the interpretation.
