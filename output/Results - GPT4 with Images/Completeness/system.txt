1. **Incomplete and/or Missing Details in the System Requirements Section:**
   - The System Requirements section lacks specific details on security requirements, especially considering the importance of patient data privacy and the need to protect the system against unauthorized access.
   - There is no mention of interoperability requirements with other medical systems or electronic health records (EHRs), which is crucial for integrated patient care.
   - The document does not address software update mechanisms or requirements for maintaining the system over time, including compatibility with future standards or regulations.
   - Requirements for user authentication, authorization, and audit trails are missing, which are essential for ensuring that only authorized personnel can operate the ventilator and for tracking user actions for accountability.
   - The document lacks requirements related to environmental conditions under which the ventilator must operate, such as temperature, humidity, and electromagnetic compatibility.

2. **Functional Requirements Table:**
   - The Functional Requirements table appears to be complete with respect to the fields for ID, Requirement/Rationale, and Input Reference. Each requirement is clearly identified, described, and justified, with references to standards where applicable.

3. **Measured and Displayed Parameters Table:**
   - The table is complete with fields for ID, Requirement/Rationale, and Input Reference adequately filled out. Each parameter to be measured and displayed is listed with a rationale, often referencing regulatory requirements.

4. **Common Values and Ranges Table:**
   - The table is mostly complete, but the default values for some parameters (e.g., PER.1 and PER.2) are marked with an underscore (_), indicating missing information. This could lead to ambiguity in setting initial values.

5. **Default Values and Ranges for PCV Parameters Table:**
   - This table is complete with all required fields filled out, providing clear default values, ranges, and step sizes for PCV mode parameters.

6. **Default Values and Ranges for PSV Parameters Table:**
   - The table is complete, offering detailed default settings, ranges, and step sizes for PSV mode parameters, facilitating clear guidance for setting up PSV ventilation.

7. **Default Alarm Thresholds Values and Ranges Table:**
   - The table is complete, but like in the Common Values and Ranges table, some default values are missing (e.g., PER.17 and PER.18 marked with an underscore), which could lead to confusion regarding initial alarm settings.

8. **Interface between GUI and Controller Table:**
   - The table is complete, detailing the parameters communicated between the GUI and the controller, ensuring clarity in the interface requirements for both displaying information to the user and receiving input from the user.

9. **Interface between Hardware and Controller Table:**
   - This table is complete, specifying the parameters set in the hardware by the controller and the values the controller must retrieve from the hardware sensors, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the hardware-controller interface.

10. **Alarm Requirements Table:**
    - The table is complete with all required fields adequately filled out, listing each alarm requirement with a rationale and input reference, ensuring a thorough understanding of the alarm system's design and its regulatory compliance.
