Evaluating the Introduction section and its sub-sections for ambiguities, unclear statements, or potential misunderstandings:

### 1. Introduction Section as a Whole

**Ambiguities or Unclear Statements:**

- The statement "with some simplifications to make it suitable as a case study" is vague. It does not specify what aspects or features have been simplified, aside from the removal of the supervisor component. This could lead to misunderstandings about the scope and capabilities of the ventilator as presented in this document.
- The term "limited cost" is subjective and lacks a clear definition. What constitutes a "limited cost" could vary significantly between different stakeholders.

### 2. Mechanical Lung Ventilator Subsection

**Ambiguities or Unclear Statements:**

- The description of the ventilator's operation modes (PCV and PSV) is technical and dense, which might be hard to follow for readers not familiar with mechanical ventilation. Specifically, the transition criteria between modes and the conditions for initiating a new respiratory cycle could be more clearly explained.
- The explanation of the inspiratory and expiratory pauses and the recruitment maneuver could benefit from more context or simplified descriptions to make them more accessible to non-specialist readers.
- The role and functionality of the "supervisor" component that was removed are mentioned briefly but not explained in detail. This omission could lead to confusion about how its responsibilities are now managed within the system.

### 3. Structure of the Document Subsection

**Ambiguities or Unclear Statements:**

- The document structure is outlined clearly, but there is no mention of how the removal of the supervisor component affects the structure or content of the document. Given that the supervisor's responsibilities could impact several areas (alarms, monitoring, etc.), it's unclear if these aspects are covered elsewhere in the document.
- The "Requirement Numbering Convention" is a useful addition, but it's not explicitly stated whether this convention applies to the entire document or specific sections. This could potentially lead to confusion when referencing requirements.

### 4. Suggested Outcomes Subsection

**Ambiguities or Unclear Statements:**

- The phrase "no formal method has been applied, mainly because a lack of developersâ€™ skills with any formal method" is somewhat ambiguous regarding whether it refers to past development efforts on the MVM or a general statement about the industry. Clarification would help understand the context better.
- The statement "we want to propose this case study in order to demonstrate the feasibility of developing the ventilator by using a formal method based approach" suggests a future-oriented activity but does not specify who "we" refers to or the intended audience or participants for this case study.
- The list of possible outcomes is described as "non-exhaustive," which is understandable, but it might benefit from specifying key areas of focus or priority to guide research activities more effectively.

Overall, while the Introduction section provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanical lung ventilator and the document structure, there are several areas where clarifications and additional details could enhance understanding and reduce potential ambiguities.
