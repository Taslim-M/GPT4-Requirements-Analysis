Figure 2.1 illustrates the high-level operation diagram for a mechanical lung ventilator, presented as a UML activity diagram. Below is a descriptive prompt that details the diagram:

- The process begins with the "Start-up" stage and immediately moves to a decision point with the condition `<new patient?>`.
    - If the answer is 'yes', the ventilator performs a "SelfTest".
      - If the self-test is successful (denoted by "selftestPassed"), the system transitions to the "StandBy" stage.
    - If the answer is 'no', the system directly transitions to "StandBy" stage.
- From "StandBy," the ventilator can move to "Ventilation" by either starting PCV (Pressure-Controlled Ventilation) or PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation), as indicated by "startPCV" or "startPSV".
- The "Ventilation" stage encapsulates two modes of operation:
  - "PCV" can loop back on itself or transition to "PSV". The diagram implies that the system can switch between these modes during ventilation.
  - "PSV" can likewise loop back to itself, indicating continuous pressure support ventilation until another action is taken.
- If ventilation is to be stopped, the "stopVentilation" transition leads back to "StandBy".
- An "error" event during "Ventilation" leads the diagram to a "FailSafe" stage, which indicates a safety mechanism to handle malfunction scenarios.
- The diagram has two explicit "powerOff" transitions:
  - One from the "FailSafe" stage, illustrating that the system can be turned off after a failure from any of the stages.
  - The other at the end of the "Ventilation" phase, showing that the system can be turned off after use from any of the stages.

The various transitions between stages are represented by arrows, and the entire process flow is encapsulated between a start (a filled circle) and an end (a circle with a concentric dark circle) indicator.
