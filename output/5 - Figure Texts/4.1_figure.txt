Figure 4.1 depicts the Controller state machine of a mechanical lung ventilator. The UML diagram is a state diagram that describes the various states and transitions of the ventilator's controller. Below are the details of the diagram in well-defined points:

1. **Start-up State**:
   - There is an initial state indicated by a solid circle, which transitions to the "Start-up" state when a `powerOn` event occurs.
   - Once start-up has completed (`start-up ended`), the system transitions to the "SelfTest" state.
   - An `error` transition will move the system from the "Start-up" state to the "FailSafe" state.
   - Should a `powerOff` event occur, the system will immediately transition to a final state, indicated by a circle with a surrounding ring.

2. **SelfTest State**:
   - In this state, the system performs a self-test to ensure that the ventilator is functioning correctly.
   - If the self-test is passed (`selftestPassed`), or if there is a command to resume ventilation, it transitions to the "VentilationOff" state.
   - An `error` transition will move the system from the "SelfTest" state to the "FailSafe" state.
   - The "SelfTest" state can also transition to the final state if a `powerOff` event occurs.

3. **VentilationOff State**:
   - This is where the ventilator is not actively ventilating the patient.
   - From this state, `startPCV` command initiates Pressure Controlled Ventilation ("PCV" state) and `startPSV` command initiates Pressure Support Ventilation ("PSV" state).
   - An `error` transition will move the system from the "VentilationOff" state to the "FailSafe" state.
   - A `powerOff` event here, as with other states, leads to the final state.

4. **PCV State**:
   - This states represent the active ventilation mode - Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV).
   - When active in PCV mode, a `moveToPSV` command can transition the system to PSV mode.
   - If ventilation needs to be stopped (`stopVentilation`), the system goes back to "VentilationOff" state.
   - An `error` transition will move the system from the "PCV" state to the "FailSafe" state.
   - A `powerOff` event here, as with other states, leads to the final state.

5. **PSV States**
   - This states represent the active ventilation modes - Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).
   - When active in PSV mode, an `apneaLag` command can transition the system to PCV mode.
   - If ventilation needs to be stopped (`stopVentilation`), the system goes back to "VentilationOff" state.
   - An `error` transition will move the system from the "PSV" state to the "FailSafe" state.
   - A `powerOff` event here, as with other states, leads to the final state.
   
6. **Transitions between Modes**:
   - The system can transition between PCV and PSV modes as mentioned, allowing the ventilator to adapt to the treatment required.
   - There is a special notation for "apneaLag," indicating a specific condition that relates to the transition within the ventilation modes.
   
7. **FailSafe State**:
   - The "FailSafe" state is reached if an error is detected during any of the state phases.
   - From here, a `powerOff` event happens in "FailSafe" state, and the system moves to the final state.


The diagram uses standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations for states, transitions, events, and the initial and final states to depict the workflow of the controller within a mechanical lung ventilator.
