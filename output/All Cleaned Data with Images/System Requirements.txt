2 System Requirements
This chapter contains a high-level description of the system requirements, defining the functional requirements and interface requirements. The requirements are generic and independent of any technical solution to allow greater flexibility in the ventilator development.
2.1 Functional Requirements
These requirements cover normal operating modes, e.g., start-up, PCV, PSV, and any direct responses required following abnormal operation, e.g., pressure relief, alarm conditions for control systems.

Figure 2.1: High level operation diagram
Figure 2.1 illustrates the high-level operation diagram for a mechanical lung ventilator, presented as a UML activity diagram. Below is a descriptive prompt that details the diagram:

- The process begins with the "Start-up" stage and immediately moves to a decision point with the condition `<new patient?>`.
    - If the answer is 'yes', the ventilator performs a "SelfTest".
      - If the self-test is successful (denoted by "selftestPassed"), the system transitions to the "StandBy" stage.
    - If the answer is 'no', the system directly transitions to "StandBy" stage.
- From "StandBy," the ventilator can move to "Ventilation" by either starting PCV (Pressure-Controlled Ventilation) or PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation), as indicated by "startPCV" or "startPSV".
- The "Ventilation" stage encapsulates two modes of operation:
  - "PCV" can loop back on itself or transition to "PSV". The diagram implies that the system can switch between these modes during ventilation.
  - "PSV" can likewise loop back to itself, indicating continuous pressure support ventilation until another action is taken.
- If ventilation is to be stopped, the "stopVentilation" transition leads back to "StandBy".
- An "error" event during "Ventilation" leads the diagram to a "FailSafe" stage, which indicates a safety mechanism to handle malfunction scenarios.
- The diagram has two explicit "powerOff" transitions:
  - One from the "FailSafe" stage, illustrating that the system can be turned off after a failure from any of the stages.
  - The other at the end of the "Ventilation" phase, showing that the system can be turned off after use from any of the stages.

The various transitions between stages are represented by arrows, and the entire process flow is encapsulated between a start (a filled circle) and an end (a circle with a concentric dark circle) indicator.


ID - Requirement / Rationale - Input Ref.
FUN.1 - The system shall provide ventilation support for patients who require mechanical ventilation and weigh more than 40 kg (88 lbs). Rationale: ventilation of children and infants is more challenging
FUN.2 - The system shall provide pressure regulated ventilation controlling the inspiratory pressure. Rationale: pressure regulated ventilation is most beneficial for COVID-19 patients
FUN.3 - The system shall provide positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. Rationale: PEEP is important to keep alveoli recruited at the end of expiration
FUN.4 - The system shall implement the following operating modes:
1. Start-up Mode: The Start-up Mode initializes the
system and is part of a start-up procedure to get
the system ready to be used to ventilate a patient.
2. SelfTest Mode: The SelfTest Mode ensures that the
system is fully functional and is part of the startup procedure to get the system ready to be used to
ventilate a new patient
3. Standby Mode: In the Standby Mode the ventilation is ready for ventilating a patient, ventilation is
off, and ventilation parameters can be set.
4. Pressure Controlled Ventilation Mode (PCV): Pressure Controlled Ventilation mode is a normal operating mode that is used when patients have no
spontaneous respiration.
5. Pressure Support Ventilation Mode (PSV): Pressure Support Ventilation is a normal operating
mode that during which the patient initiates each
breath and the ventilator supports the breath at the
appropriate pressure level.
6. Fail-safe mode: the controller detects a severe condition that required an alarm to be raised and to
bring the machine to a fail-safe mode (in valve
closed and out valve open).
Rationale: Pressure Controlled and Pressure Support
Ventilation are the two basic modes of pressure regulated
support needed for COVID-19 patients. A Start-up mode
is needed to properly ensure that the system is fully functional before starting the ventilation of a patient. Pressure Controlled Ventilation is needed for patients in respiratory failure or fully sedated. Pressure Support Ventilation is needed for patients able to breathe on their own,
in particular during the weaning process.

FUN.5 - The Start-up Mode shall be initiated by pushing the power button of the system once the system has been connected to the breathing circuit (without connection to the patient), the air supply, and the power source. Rationale: need to turn on the system once all connections are attached so the sensors and valves can be properly tested.
FUN.5.1 - Upon initiation of the Start-up Mode, the system shall go through an initialization process that loads default parameters and checks the system memory and the communication of the controller with the sensors and valves, as well as between the controller and the GUI. Rationale: Need to ensure that the system properly started.
FUN.5.2 - The system shall indicate to the user that the initialization process has been completed successfully or failed. In case of a failure the user shall be warned that the system is out-of-service. In addition, any other operations shall be not allowed. Rationale: only a fully functional unit shall be used with a patient
FUN.5.3 - The patient shall not be connected to the breathing circuit when the system is powered on and through start-up and self-test.
FUN.6 - The system shall have a self-test procedure that ensures the system and its accessories are fully functional and the alarms work. - ISO 80601-2-12 201.7.9.2.8.101
FUN.6.1 - The self-test procedure shall confirm the switchover from external to internal power works.
FUN.6.2 - The self-test procedure shall confirm there are no unacceptable leaks in the breathing circuit.
FUN.6.3 - The self-test procedure shall confirm the FI2 flow meter (see Figure 2.2) in the patient breathing circuit is connected in the right direction and is calibrated.

FUN.8.1 - The system shall have means to indicate visually the cumulative hours of operation of the ventilator, either 1) automatically; or 2) by operator action. - ISO 80601-2-12: 201.104
FUN.8.2 - The system shall be equipped with an alarm system log with a capacity of at least 1000 events in total for: high priority alarm conditions; medium priority alarm conditions; and alarm signal inactivation states - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.3 - The system shall time stamp all alarm events either via the date and time, the elapsed time since the occurrence of the alarm condition, or the elapsed time from the start of use of system - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.4 - The system shall not lose the contents of the alarm system log during a loss of power for less than 7 d unless erased by authorized personnel of the hospital. - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.5 - The system shall not permit the healthcare professional operator to erase the contents of the alarm system log. - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.6 - The system shall provide a log to include any change of ventilator settings, including the value applied - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.7 - The system shall provide a log to include any change of alarm settings, including the value applied - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101

FUN.8.9 - The system shall provide a log to include power supply source change, including the source utilized - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.10 - The system shall provide a log to include results of the pre-use check. - ISO 80601-2-12:208.6.12.101
FUN.8.11 - The system shall provide a log to include the overall duration of the active use of the O2 sensor (%-hours). Rationale: The oxygen sensor has a limited lifetime expectancy requiring a monitoring of its use in order to track its deterioration over time
FUN.8.12 - The system shall log user-set ventilation and alarm parameters as well as the current calibration parameters. Rationale: user-set ventilation and alarm parameters need to be able for the resumption of ventilation in case the system has to be briefly turned off.
FUN.9 - Once the self-test has been completed successfully and configurations have been loaded properly the system shall start monitoring and reporting health parameters. Rationale: At this point the monitoring module is able to carry out its assigned functionality.
FUN.10 - Once the start-up has been completed successfully the user must select “New Patient” or “Resume Ventilation” before the system transitions to self-test mode. Rationale: in order to quickly resume ventilation for the same patient in case the unit had to be powered down
FUN.10.1 - If “New Patient” is selected, the user shall have to enter patient attributes and the completion of every step of the self-test procedure (FUN.6) shall be mandatory
FUN.10.2 - If “Resume Ventilation” is selected, the system shall load the last calibration parameters, alarm thresholds, and ventilation parameters from the last active patient ventilation.
FUN.10.3 - If “Resume Ventilation” is selected, every step of the selftest procedure FUN.6 can be skipped or optionally rerun individually.
FUN.10.4 - Once all self-test steps have been completed successfully, it shall be possible to proceed to the Standby Mode.
FUN.10.5 - In Standby Mode ventilation shall be off and it shall be possible to adjust all user-controlled parameters for ventilation and alarms before connecting to the patient and starting patient ventilation.
FUN.10.6 - Once the power of the system has been off for more than 15 minutes it shall not be possible to select “Resume Ventilation”
FUN.11 - The system shall connect to pressurized gas supply of oxygen and medical air and accept pressures up to 5.2 bar. Rationale: this covers the range of pressures available in hospital setting
FUN.12 - The system shall provide breathing air through a standard medical supply single-limbed patient circuit with a pneumatically controlled diaphragm expiration valve. Rationale: this is readily available medical supply
FUN.13 - The system shall measure and display the breathing rate (number of breathes per minute). Rationale: observing and identifying the monitored ventilation parameters is considered a primary operating function - ISO 80601-2-12 206.101
FUN.14 - The system shall measure and display the percentage of oxygen in the gas being delivered to the patient. Rationale: observing and identifying the monitored ventilation parameters is considered a primary operating function - ISO 80601-2-12 206.101
FUN.15 - The system shall measure the ventilator pressure at/near the inlet to the patient. Rationale: observing and identifying the monitored ventilation parameters is considered a primary operating function - ISO 80601-2-12 201.12.4.102 (b)
FUN.16 - The system shall measure and display the volume of gas delivered to the patient per breathing cycle (tidal volume). Rationale: observing and identifying the monitored ventilation parameters is considered a primary operating function - ISO 80601-2-12 206.101
FUN.17 - The system shall measure and display the flow of gas delivered to the patient per breathing cycle. Rationale: observing and identifying the monitored ventilation parameters is considered a primary operating function - ISO 80601-2-12 206.101
FUN.18 - The system shall have a leak compensation feature for leaks in the patient breathing circuit which shall be disabled by default. Rationale: regulatory requirement
FUN.18.1 - The user shall be able to disable/enable the leak compensation feature at any time.
FUN.18.2 - When enabled, the leak compensation shall be activated by the Min PEEP alarm (SAV.15)
FUN.19 - The system shall have a pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode, as characterized by the following plots of pressure and flow versus time. Rationale: this is the most appropriate procedure for COVID-19 patients as it allows the immediate reopening of the alveoli and is strongly recommended by the doctors and nurses in the COVID-19 wards of Lombardy, rather than the constant flow procedure. These characteristics of the ventilator pressure transient during the inspiratory cycle are crucial to avoid barotrauma and to minimise long term fatigue of muscles and alveoli induced by forced mechanical ventilation.
FUN.20 - In PCV mode, the breathing cycle shall be defined by inspiratory pressure P_insp_PCV relative to atmosphere, respiratory rate (RR_PCV ) and the ratio between the inspiratory and expiratory times (I:E_PCV ). Rationale: standard parameters to define PCV. Note: The time for one breathing cycle will be equal to 1/RR_PCV . The expiratory time will be equal to 1/RR_PCV 1+I:E_PCV. For instance, if RR is 10 cycles for minutes and I:E is 1:2, the respiratory cycle will last 6 seconds, the inspiratory phase will last 2 seconds and the expiratory phase 4 seconds.
FUN.21 - In PCV mode, a new breathing cycle shall be initiated either after a breathing cycle is over, or by patient request during expiration. Rationale: while the main mode of PCV is the control of the breathing cycle timing by the ventilator, the patient has to have the ability to trigger a breath on his own
FUN.21.1 - A new breathing cycle shall be initiated by a sudden drop in pressure above a user-settable threshold (Inhale Trigger Sensitivity). Rationale: In a pressure-regulated ventilator, the intensity of pressure drop initiated by the patient is the easiest way to detect the spontaneous breathing attempt
FUN.21.2 - A patient breath trigger shall reset the timer for the timecycled breathing cycle. Rationale: Avoid breath stacking, which would lead to hyperventilation
FUN.22 - In PCV mode it shall be possible to initiate with the push of a single button a lung recruitment procedure, termed Recruitment Maneuver (RM). Note: This maneuver is not allowed in North America. Rationale: The RM is an emergency procedure required immediately after intubation. RM consists in the prolonged lung inflation at increased inspiratory set pressure, as necessary to reactivate the alveoli immediately after intubation.
FUN.23 - The system shall provide means to switch from PCV to PSV while PCV ventilation is active. Rationale: the switchover between modes should not require stopping the ventilation in order to maintain ventilation of the patient
FUN.23.1 - When a PCV-to-PSV switch is initiated by the user the system shall ask the user for confirmation/setting of PSV parameters to be used
FUN.23.2 - The switch to PSV shall occur only after the PSV parameters have been confirmed and until that has happened the PCV ventilation shall continue
FUN.23.3 - The switch to PSV shall occur at the end of a PCV inspiratory time
FUN.24 - The system shall have a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, as characterized by the following plots of pressure and flow versus time. Rationale: In PSV mode, the ventilator supports the patient who is supposed to breathe spontaneously. PSV is needed to wean patients off the ventilation by allowing them to strengthen the muscles involved in breathing. PSV is not suitable for patients unable to initiate breaths on their own.
FUN.25 - In PSV mode the breathing cycle shall be initiated by a sudden drop in pressure above a user-settable threshold (Inhale Trigger Sensitivity) Rationale: In a pressure-regulated ventilator, the speed of pressure drop initiated by the patient is the easiest way to detect the spontaneous breathing attempt as per ventilator experts
FUN.26 - In PSV mode the expiration phase shall start when the inspiratory flow drops below a setable fraction of the peak flow (Expiratory Trigger Setting). Rationale: Dropping inspiratory flow indicates the end of the inspiration
FUN.27 - In PSV mode the system shall check for the presence of apnea, which occurs when a patient does not take new breath within the allowable apnea lag time. Rationale: In case the patient stops breathing (apnea) the system needs to be able to ensure that the patient continues to be ventilated.
FUN.27.1 - If apnea is detected, an apnea alarm shall be triggered. Rationale: Clinician needs to be made aware of the fact that patient stops breathing
FUN.27.2 - If apnea is detected, the system shall automatically switch from PSV to PCV mode with pre-determined apnea backup settings for RR_AP , P_insp AP , I:E_AP . RR_AP and P_insp AP shall be set by the user. I:E_AP will be fixed at 1:2. Rationale: in case of apnea the ventilator needs to take over and ensure that ventilation continues to assure patient safety
FUN.28 - In PCV and PSV mode there shall be the possibility to press a single button to initiate an Expiratory Pause that closes both inspiratory and expiratory valve at the end of the expiration phase as long as the operator holds the button but no longer than 60 sec. Rationale: The expiratory pause allows the determination of the residual pressure above the PEEP level, the residual value being PEEP + AutoPEEP. AutoPEEP level for the patient, providing information on the level of obstruction in the exhalation channel. AutoPEEP may be zero for most patients or significantly different from zero for patients that have obstructions in the exhalation channel, as possibly generated by secretions. In this case, the small flow during exhalation may result in an incomplete drain of the alveoli during the expiration phase. - ISO 80601-2-12 201.107.1
FUN.29 - In PCV and PSV mode there shall be the possibility to press a single button to initiate an Inspiratory Pause (IP) that closes both inspiratory and expiratory valve at the end of the inspiratory phase as long as the operator holds the button but no longer than 40 sec. Rationale: The Inspiratory Pause will, allowing for the measurement of the Plateau Pressure (PP), the pressure reached inside the alveoli at the end of the inspiratory cycle. PP may be lower than the target inspiratory pressure P_insp provided by the ventilator. The difference between PP and the PEEP is called Driving Pressure, DP (DP = PP - PEEP). - ISO 80601-2-12 201.107.2
FUN.30 - The high-level operation sequence shall follow the scheme shown in Figure 2.1

FUN.38.1 - The system shall raise an alarm when a parameter value goes outside the range defined for its associated alarm.
FUN.39 - The system shall prompt the user before ventilation is started to enter user-controlled alarm thresholds for SAV.3- SAV.9 Rationale: alarm thresholds may vary from patient to patient
FUN.40 - The system shall react to the inspiratory airway pressure at the patient being exceeded (Max P_insp alarm SAV.4) (e.g. by coughing) by truncating the inspiratory phase and immediately transitioning to expiration, quickly relieving the pressure. Rationale: need to avoid excessive pressure in the lungs
FUN.41 - A failure of the GUI (e.g. GUI freezes) or a loss of communication between the GUI and the Controller shall raise a high-priority alarm and any ongoing ventilation process shall not be interrupted. Rationale: in order to keep the patient safe, the ventilation needs to continue even if there is no connection between the controller and the GUI

2.4 Sensors and interfaces

2.4.1 Sensors

Figure 2.2: High level view of ventilator sensors
- **Air and Oxygen Supply**: The diagram shows separate inputs for air and oxygen that feed into a gas blender (GB).
- **Gas Blender**: The GB is responsible for mixing air and oxygen. It is equipped with a pressure sensor (PS) to monitor the pressure of the gas mixture.
- **IN Valve**: The gas mixture then passes through the IN valve, which regulates the entry of the gas into the ventilator.
- **Sensors**: 
  - The flow sensor FI1 measures the unidirectional flow of gas to the patient.
  - The oxygen concentration sensor (OS) measures the oxygen level in the gas being delivered to the patient.
  - The pressure sensor PS ins measures the pressure in the entrance to the patient.
- **Ventilator Representation**: The ventilator is depicted as a central box from which the gas is delivered to the patient (indicated by the silhouette of a human upper body and respiratory system).
- **Flow Path to Patient**: After the ventilator, the flow sensor FI2 measures the bidirectional flow of gas between the ventilator and the patient.
- **Exhalation**: Following the passage through the patient's system, the gas is expelled through the OUT valve. The pressure sensor PS exp measures the pressure in the expiratory line.
- **PEEP Valve**: The Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve ensures a minimum level of pressure is maintained in the lungs after exhalation.
- **GUI**: A Graphic User Interface (GUI) connected to the ventilator allows for monitoring and control of the ventilation process. This interface includes a switch (activated by alternating current AC or a battery), and has an LED indicator.
- **Legends**: An additional legend box provides abbreviations and their meanings: GB stands for gas blender with pressure sensor (PS), PS for pressure sensor, OS for oxygen concentration sensor, FI1 for unidirectional flow sensor, FI2 for bidirectional flow sensor, PS ins for pressure sensor at the entrance to the patient, and PS exp for pressure sensor on the expiratory line.

2.4.3 Interface between Hardware and Controller
ID - Requirement / Rationale - Input Ref.
The controller shall set the following parameters in the HW :
INT.46 - The value of the proportional solenoid valve that controls the inspiratory pressure to the patient (IN valve). Rationale: the controller computes the value of the in valve to allow the patient the inspiration.
INT.47 - The value of the three-way simple solenoid valve used to control the pressure to the valve that permits patient expiratory breath (OUT valve). The port connected to the expiratory valve is normally open to the atmosphere. Rationale: the controller commands the out valve to allow the patient expiration.
INT.48 - The value of the LED when an alarm is raised/reset

The controller shall get the values from the following sensors (HW):
INT.49 - The digital spirometer flow sensor (FI1).
INT.50 - The electronic oxygen sensor (0% - 100%) (OS).
INT.51 - The differential pressure sensor to measure the flow to the patient (FI2).
INT.52 - The sensor that measures the expiratory pressure near the patient (PEEP) (PS exp).
INT.53 - The sensor that measures inspiratory pressure provided by the ventilator (PS ins).
INT.54 - The sensor that measures the supply gas pressure to the ventilator (GB).
INT.55 - Temperature
INT.56 - Battery charge level
INT.57 - Power supply type
INT.58 - Fan Tachometer
